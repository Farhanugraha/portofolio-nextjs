# Overview

This project aims to classify brain tumors from MRI images to support early and accurate diagnosis. The model leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the VGG-16 architecture.

## Key Features

- **Tumor Classification**: Distinguishes between normal and tumor MRI scans.
- **Early Diagnosis Support**: Helps medical professionals make faster, data-driven decisions.
- **Dataset Handling**: Processed over 3,000 MRI images for training and validation.

## Technical Details

- **Deep Learning Architecture**: Utilized VGG-16 with fine-tuning on the last layers.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Applied normalization, resizing, and augmentation for better generalization.
- **Training & Validation**: Achieved 99% training accuracy, indicating strong model performance.
- **Environment**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Matplotlib, and Google Colab.

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Overfitting**: Applied data augmentation and dropout layers to improve model generalization.
- **Limited Data**: Used pre-trained VGG-16 weights to leverage transfer learning.
- **High Accuracy Requirement**: Monitored training closely and adjusted learning rate and batch size for optimal performance.

## Outcome

The project successfully trained a high-performing CNN model capable of classifying brain tumors from MRI images, achieving 99% training accuracy and providing a strong foundation for early diagnosis support in medical applications.
